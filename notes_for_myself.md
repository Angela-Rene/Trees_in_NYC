Presentation and Project Plan wording ideas


1. Abstract Overview (High-Level Summary)
This gives readers a brief understanding of what your project is about, your general approach, and why it matters. It's like a 4–5 sentence elevator pitch.

This project explores the relationship between urban trees and environmental health in New York City. By combining data from the NYC Tree Census with environmental indicators like air quality and energy efficiency, the project investigates whether the presence, type, and condition of trees contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable city. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns that might suggest how urban greenery supports public health and environmental resilience. Findings from this work could inform future decisions in urban planning, environmental policy, and climate adaptation strategies.

2. Problem Statement
This defines the specific issue you’re addressing and the opportunity it presents. It should explain why the project is necessary, what is currently lacking, and what potential impact solving it could have.

While trees are known to offer environmental and social benefits, there is limited understanding of how their presence and health influence key environmental indicators in densely populated cities. In places like New York City—where air pollution, energy consumption, and climate resilience are critical concerns—there’s a growing need to better understand how natural infrastructure, such as urban trees, can contribute to healthier urban ecosystems. This project aims to fill that gap by exploring how different aspects of urban trees (e.g., quantity, species, and condition) relate to air quality and energy efficiency metrics. This information could support smarter, greener decisions in areas like city planning, public health, and environmental justice.

3. Primary Goal
This is a focused statement of what you're aiming to accomplish. It should be specific, action-oriented, and ideally measurable.

The primary goal of this project is to determine whether there is a meaningful correlation between tree characteristics (such as number, type, and health) and environmental outcomes (such as air quality and energy efficiency) in New York City, using publicly available datasets and data analysis techniques. The project seeks to provide evidence that can support urban sustainability efforts and environmental planning decisions.


Slide Version-

Slide 1: Project Overview
Title:
Can Trees Make Cities Healthier?

Overview:
This project explores how urban trees might help create a cleaner, greener, and more livable New York City.
Using tree census data alongside air quality and energy efficiency information, I’m looking for patterns that show whether the number, type, or health of trees is linked to a healthier environment.
The big idea? Trees might do more than just look nice—they could play a vital role in urban sustainability and public health.

Slide 2: What Problem Am I Exploring?
Title:
The Opportunity Behind the Data

The Problem:
We know trees are good for cities—but how good?
There’s not enough clear, data-driven insight into how the presence or condition of trees actually impacts things like air quality, energy use, or community health—especially in a dense, complex city like NYC.
By digging into public data, this project fills that gap and explores how urban trees might support smarter city planning, stronger climate policy, and better public health outcomes.

Slide 3: Project Goal
Title:
What I’m Trying to Find Out

Primary Goal:
To discover whether there’s a meaningful connection between urban tree coverage (how many trees, what kind, and how healthy they are) and indicators of environmental health, like air quality or energy efficiency.
By doing this, I hope to uncover patterns that show how trees contribute to healthier, more sustainable city life—and provide insights that can support future urban decision-making.


FEATURES-
Main Features & Functionalities of the Project
1. Data Integration
Load and clean NYC Tree Census data.
Load air quality and/or energy efficiency data.
Merge datasets based on shared geography (e.g., ZIP code, borough, neighborhood, latitude/longitude).

2. Data Exploration & Visualization
Visualize tree distribution across the city (e.g., heatmaps, bar charts by borough).
Explore trends in air quality and/or energy use by location.
Compare environmental metrics across areas with different tree densities or conditions.

3. Custom Functions
I need at least three. examples/ideas:

Function Ideas:
calculate_tree_density(df)
Takes a DataFrame and returns tree density per ZIP code or neighborhood (e.g., trees per square mile or per 1,000 residents).

get_air_quality_trends(df, location_col)
Extracts and averages air quality readings over time for selected locations.

score_tree_health(df)
Assigns a numeric score to tree health (e.g., good = 2, fair = 1, poor = 0) and aggregates by area to quantify overall "green health."

compare_environmental_metrics(df1, df2, join_col)
Joins tree and environmental data, then compares metrics to detect possible correlations.

filter_by_tree_species(df, species_name)
Returns a subset of the DataFrame filtered by a specific tree species for species-based analysis.

count_species_per_area(df, area_col)
Counts how many different tree species exist in each ZIP code or borough—can be used with a biodiversity column.

map_tree_age(df)
Estimates tree age using diameter-at-breast-height (DBH), if available, based on species-specific growth rates.

group_by_geography(df, area_col)
Groups data by neighborhood, ZIP, or borough and aggregates tree health, density, or other stats.

normalize_by_population(df, pop_col, feature_col)
Calculates per capita or per 1,000 resident values for any environmental or tree variable.

match_environmental_data(df1, df2, geo_col)
Merges tree and air quality/energy datasets using a shared geographic identifier, handles missing values.


((Analytical / Visualization Helpers
plot_tree_health_distribution(df)
A quick way to visualize how tree health statuses are distributed citywide or by region.

calculate_correlation_matrix(df, cols)
Returns a correlation matrix between selected features (e.g., tree count, AQI, energy use).

label_environmental_quality(df, air_quality_col)
Categorizes air quality (e.g., Good, Moderate, Poor) based on AQI thresholds.))





NEW COLUMN IDEAS:

tree_health_score
Assign numerical values to tree health status, then aggregate by neighborhood to get an average "green health" index.

is_high_tree_area (binary feature)
Create a flag where 1 = areas above the citywide median tree density, 0 = below median. Useful for modeling or correlation analysis.

species_diversity_index
Use Shannon diversity index or count of unique species per area to measure biodiversity.

estimated_CO2_absorbed
Estimate total CO₂ absorption by combining tree count and species (some trees absorb more than others). Even a rough estimate can add environmental depth.

trees_per_capita
Combine tree data with population data to calculate how many trees exist per resident per area.

Note for VS Code Users:

If you're using VS Code to run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script, ensure that the virtual environment(venv) is selected as the kernel. This is necessary for the modules installed from requirements.txt to be active when running the project.

To select the kernel, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) and search for "Python: Select Interpreter". Choose the one for the virtual environment (venv).
