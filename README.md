# Branching Toward Sustainability: How NYC's Urban Forest Supports a Healthier City
This project explores the relationship between urban trees and environmental health in New York City. By combining data from the NYC Tree Census with environmental indicators like air quality and energy efficiency, the project investigates whether the presence, type, and condition of trees contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable city. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns that might suggest how urban greenery supports public health and environmental resilience. Findings from this work could inform future decisions in urban planning, environmental policy, and climate adaptation strategies.
